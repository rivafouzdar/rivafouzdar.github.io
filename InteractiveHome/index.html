          <h2 id="textBox1">Amazon Echo</h2>
          <h3 id="textBox2">Amazon Echo (shortened and referred to as Echo) is a brand of smart speakers developed by Amazon.com. The devices connect to the voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant service Alexa, which responds to the name "Alexa". This "wake word" can be changed by the user to "Amazon", "Echo" or "Computer".The device is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic and other real-time information. It can also control several smart devices acting as a home automation hub.
          Amazon had been developing Echo devices inside its Lab126 offices in Silicon Valley and Cambridge, Massachusetts since at least 2010 in confirmed reports. The device was part of Amazon’s first attempts to expand its device portfolio beyond the Kindle e-reader. The Echo was prominently featured in Amazon's first-ever Super Bowl ad in 2016.</h3>

          <h3 id="textBox2">Philips Hue is a line of Wi-Fi-enabled color changing LED lamps and white bulbs created by Philips. It was introduced in October 2012 and was updated in both 2015 and 2016. Philips Lighting re-branded as Signify in 2018 - however the Philips brand will still be used on products. The Hue system was released in October 2012 as an Apple Store exclusive. The Hue system was marketed as the first iOS controlled lighting appliance. It uses the Zigbee lighting protocol to communicate, and can be controlled via smartphone apps over Wi-Fi via a Zigbee–Wi‑Fi bridge. The initial system had bulbs capable of producing up to 600 lumens while the newer systems have bulbs that shine up to 800 lumens. The newer system also features HomeKit compatibility. In July 2018, an outdoor version of the Philips Hue suite will be introduced.</h3>

Introduced in September 2002, Roomba features a set of sensors that enable it to perform its tasks. For instance, the Roomba is able to change direction upon encountering obstacles, to detect dirty spots on the floor, and to sense steep drops to keep it from falling down stairs. Roomba uses two independently operating side wheels that allow 360° turns in place. A rotating, 3-prong spinner brush can sweep debris from square corners into the vacuum slot under the round unit.</h3>

It is based on a machine learning algorithm: for the first weeks users have to regulate the thermostat in order to provide the reference data set. Nest can then learn people's schedule, at which temperature they are used to and when. Using built-in sensors and phones' locations it can shift into energy saving mode when it realizes nobody is at home.</h3>
